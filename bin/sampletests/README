Sample Test Regime

Test 1: 
javac MainApp.java

Expected result: A file named MainApp.class must be produced without compiler error.  Warnings will be ignored.


Test 2: 
java MainApp

Expected result: A valid candidate number.


Test 3:
player map3.cfg &
java MainApp 0 9.5

Expected result: The robot should move from coordinate x:0, y:0 to coordinate x:0, y:9.5 and stop at that location.


Test 4:
player map4.cfg &
java MainApp -2 2

Expected result: The robot should move from coordinate x:2, y:2 to coordinate x:-2, y:2.


Test 5: 
player map5.cfg &
java MainApp -5 -5

Expected result: The robot should move from coordinate x:3, y:4 to coordinate x:-5, y:-5.


Test 6:
player map6.cfg &
java MainApp -8 8

Expected result: The robot should move from coordinate x:8, y:-8 to coordinate x:-8, y:8.


Test 7: 
player map7.cfg &
java MainApp -8 8

Expected result: The robot should move from coordinate x:8, y:-8 to coordinate x:-8, y:8.


Test 8 will be similar to Test 7 but with more obstacles.

Test 9:
player map9.cfg &
javac ObstacleBot.java
java ObstacleBot &
java MainApp 9 9

Expected result: The robot should move to coordinate x:9 y:9 without colliding with the moving obstacles.  Note that the moving obstacles change direction when something is front of it (including your robot).
